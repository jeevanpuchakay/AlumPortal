She never went outside Indore for her whole life (except vacation though) and try to defend Indore and MP in debates.Being true Indore she likes sev very much and even had idea to make sev flavored ice cream 🤣.It was a grt experience to have such person in my life and definitely a person worth to be obsessed with. She always live in reality and avoids unnecessary imaginary perfect world. I can see her as a successful person in her future.\nShe needs to be more emotionally present in friendships though😛",
